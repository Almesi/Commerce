## 11. Workers

### Worker Limits and Movement

* 6 Workers per Player max
* 1 Worker at the beginning of the game
* Can move freely 1 Tile per Turn in any direction
* Can move +n Tiles for n = connected street
* Can only move through water if a ship connects the shore to the sea
* Maximum of 3 workers per tile (no matter if your own or combined with enemy)
* Working a tile will result in (WorkerLevel) Amount of **1** resource of the tile the worker is standing on


---

### 11.1 Enemy Roads

* When you want to use enemy roads, you and the street´s owner throw a dice
* If the owner throws higher than you, you downgrade your worker by 1(if already at 1, remove the worker entirely)
* If the street´s owner does not wish to throw dice you can pass

---

### 11.2 Combat Resolution
* If you walk onto a tile with another player on it you **may** throw dice to battle him
* For each attack, level your worker down by a level, no matter if you beat him or not
* **Attacking** another player will **not** result in level below 0 (death), ensuring death **only** when being attacked

**Combat Advantage Formula**
The battle result is dependant on the workers level:
The formula is defined as follows:
The attacker´s eyes count has to be (EnemyWorkerLevel - YourWorkerLevel + 2) higher than the defenders count
#### Example 1: Same level
Enemy Level 1
Your  Level 1
1 - 1 + 2 = 2
Enemy throws Dice = 3
You **have** to have 5 or higher

#### Example 2: Higher Attacker level
Enemy Level 1
Your  Level 3
1 - 3 + 2 = 0
Enemy throws Dice = 3
You **have** to have 3 or higher

#### Example 3: Higher Defender level
Enemy Level 3
Your  Level 1
3 - 1 + 2 = 4
Enemy throws Dice = 3
You **have** to have 7 or higher

#### Example 4: Vastly higher Attacker Level
Enemy Level 1
Your  Level 6
1 - 6 + 2 = -3
Enemy throws Dice = 3
You **have** to have 0 or higher

## 13 Settlements and cities
You collect taxes every turn
* 3 Money from every settlement
* 6 Money from every city
Both can only be build on an empty tile, that is connected to **your** Road

## 14 Streets and sea routes
They combine all cities(your own and the enemies) into a trade network.
They help the worker to move further/allow them to enter ocean tiles

## 15 Maintenance
* Every road costs 1 Money per Player turn
* Every worker level costs 1 Money per Player turn
* Every tile further from a town will add 1 Money to worker cost

Example 1: Level 1 Worker At town                   --> 1 Money
Example 2: Level 1 Worker 1 Tile away from Town     --> 2 Money
Example 3: Level 3 worker is 2 Tiles away from town --> 5 Money


## 16 Trade:
Trade is the most important part of this game, as all game mechanics are designed to encourage trade between the players, rather than with the bank or waiting for the right resource (like it is the case in Catan)
Trade in general is open and free.
That means, that there are no limits to how much you can trade, in which way, at which time, at which rate etc.
As long as all trading partners agree on the trade contract, it is fine with the rulebook.
That not only includes resources, but special event cards, cities and settlements, workers and everything else (except the tiles).
Go wild with your trade agreements and embrace the capitalism.
There is but one **caveat** for a 100% success rate on a trade you have to be in the same trade network.
If you trade without a trade network there is a chance for a bandit attack.
A bandit attack goes as follows:
1. The trade partners agree on a contract. 
2. The Partners throw dices
Now there are several cases:
1. **Case 1** all trade partners throw 1 or 2
* Everyone loses his goods to the bank
2. **Case 2** everyone who throws 1 or 2
* Those players throw all their cards into a pot
* The players with 3 eyes or more now can split the pot in any way they agree on
* If no agreement is reached every player receives their stolen goods back

## 17 World wonders:
Every era has 1 expensive world wonder that can only be build by one person.
This building gives that player a unique boost in the game

| Era             | World Wonder      |Cost                                 | Effect                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ancient**     | Pyramid           |20 Stone                             | Allows Artifacts to be acquired from Ancient time onward     |
| **Classical**   | Colloseum         |10 Stone, 10 Clay                    | receive 1 pre medieval Food every turn                       |
| **Medieval**    | Notre Dame        |10 Stone, 1 Iron                     | receive 10 gold once from the bank                           |
| **Renaissance** | Sistine Chapel    |10 Stone, 10 Iron, 5 Artifacts       | Remove worker distance cost                                  |
| **Industrial**  | Brandenburg Gate  |20 Stone, 10 Aluminium, 10 Iron      | When fighting you can reduce the needed eye amount by 1      |
| **Modern**      | Liberty Statue    |20 Stone, 10 Rare Minerals, 10 Iron  | Double any non-luxury yield                                  |


## 18 Global Events:
Global events will always happen.
What event and for how long it will last is dependant 2 factors.
1. Throw the event cube, this will determine what kind of event will happen
2. Throw a normal cube, this will determine for how many rounds this event will persist.

There are following events:
* Positive natural events --> Example: Monsoon    -->  Double food production
* Negative natural events --> Example: Drought    -->  Cut of food production
* Positive economy events --> Example: Low-Credit -->  Bank-goods only cost half as much
* Negative economy events --> Example: Bandits    -->  Every player looses half its resources

The following events are not round-based.
Rather the normal cube´s eye count determines the player offset.
For Example:
3 Eyes is 3 Players in clockwise direction from the first player
* Positive social  events --> Example: Wedding    -->  Every Player has to give you a gift
* Negative social  events --> Example: Coup       -->  You loose 1 worker to the other player

The first Event happens after the first round is finished.
Player 1 will always throw the dice´s to decide the event
If it is a social event the next event will happen at the beginning of the next round

## 19 Local Events
Local Events can be used by the player after moving the workers.
Local Events will happen instantly and once finished will go back to the bank
Local Events can be things like stealing from a player of your choosing, doubling a yield etc.
Local Event cards can be acquired the following way:
