## 1. Big Picture Gameplay Tips

### 1.1 Decide what the *core* experience is

Right now, *Commerce* is trying to do **everything**:

* 4X-style expansion
* Heavy economic simulation
* Negotiation & free trading
* Dice-based combat
* Tech race
* Global events

That’s not bad, but it *is* risky.

**Tip:**
Ask yourself:

> “If players remember one thing about this game, what should it be?”

If the answer is *trade*, then:

* Trade rules should be the cleanest
* Combat and events should support trade, not overshadow it

---

### 1.2 Expect long playtime

With:

* 6 eras
* Global tech thresholds
* Negotiation every turn
* Dice rolling for everyone every resource phase

This is likely a **3–6 hour game** with experienced players.

**Tip:**

* Put an **estimated playtime** in the rulebook
* Consider a **“short game” variant** (fewer eras or lower tech thresholds)

---

## 2. Rules Clarity & Streamlining

### 2.1 Resource phase is very powerful

> “All players collect all eligible resources.”

This is huge and easy to miss. It means:

* Worker placement timing is *everything*
* The current player may accidentally help others

**Tip:**
Add a **bold reminder** or example showing this interaction, or new players will misplay badly.

---

### 2.2 Dice are doing a *lot* of work

Dice are used for:

* Resource production
* Combat
* Road usage
* Trading without network
* Global events
* Social events

**Tip:**
Too many dice checks can feel chaotic. Consider:

* Removing dice from **one** of these areas (maybe road usage or trade bandits)
* Or adding ways to **mitigate randomness** (rerolls, modifiers, tech bonuses)

---

### 2.3 Combat math is clever but hard to parse

The combat formula works, but it’s not intuitive mid-game.

**Tip:**
Add a **quick-reference table**, e.g.:

| Level Difference (Attacker – Defender) | Attacker Needs |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| +2 or more                             | Same or higher |
| +1                                     | +1             |
| 0                                      | +2             |
| -1                                     | +3             |
| -2                                     | +4             |

This speeds play a lot.

## 3. Balance Concerns (Important)

### 3.1 Free trading can break the game

Because:

* Trades are unlimited
* Everything can be traded (even workers, cities, settlements)
* No binding enforcement except “agreement”

**Risks:**

* Kingmaking
* One player feeding another to victory
* Two-player alliances dominating others

**Tips:**

* Consider **non-transferable items** (e.g. workers, cities)
* Or add **trade limits per turn**
* Or introduce **reputation / trust penalties** for extreme trades

---

### 3.2 Maintenance costs are brutal (maybe too brutal)

Worker cost:

```
Worker Level + Distance + Roads
```

This can snowball into:

* Players being forced to delete workers
* Rich-get-richer via cities

**Tip:**

* Cap distance cost (e.g. max +3)
* Or let roads reduce maintenance, not increase it

---

### 3.3 Domination victory seems rare

> “All enemy workers have been destroyed.”

Given:

* Workers downgrade instead of dying
* Combat is costly to attacker
* Workers are limited but valuable

**Tip:**
This victory condition may almost never happen.

* Either add **alternative military victory**
* Or allow capturing instead of only downgrading

---

## 4. Tech & Era Progression

### 4.1 Global tech threshold is interesting but risky

Advancing eras depends on **total tech points of all players**.

**Pros:**

* Encourages interaction
* Prevents runaway leaders

**Cons:**

* Players can *stall* intentionally
* One player can rush others into eras they’re unprepared for

**Tip:**
Add:

* A **minimum round count per era**
* Or a **vote/consensus trigger** for era advancement

---

### 4.2 Some tech costs are funny (in a good way)

> Antimatter costs 50 Bananas 🍌

That’s memorable and fun, but:

* It will confuse new players
* It might be exploited with Liberty Statue doubling

**Tip:**
Keep jokes, but clearly label them as **intentional design choices**.

---

## 5. Events System Feedback

### 5.1 Global events are very swingy

> “Every player loses half its resources”

That can undo hours of play instantly.

**Tip:**
Consider:

* Capping losses
* Or scaling effects by era
* Or letting players spend money/resources to mitigate events

---

### 5.2 Player 1 controls events a lot

Player 1:

* Always rolls for global events
* Can repeatedly benefit from social events

**Tip:**
Rotate the event roller each round or era.

---

## 6. Presentation & Usability Tips

### 6.1 Add examples everywhere

You already do this well in combat. Do it also for:

* Trade with bandits
* Maintenance calculation
* Era advancement
* Monopoly victory

---

### 6.2 Create player aids

Highly recommended:

* Resource type cheat sheet
* Maintenance formula card
* Tech tree overview
* Era thresholds card

This will massively reduce downtime.

---

## 7. Final Overall Advice

You’ve designed something closer to:

> **A heavy economic sandbox game**
> than a traditional Euro or family game.

That’s okay — just embrace it.

**Next steps I strongly recommend:**

1. Playtest with **3–4 players max**
2. Track:

   * Game length
   * How often each victory condition happens
   * Who controls trade
3. Simplify **one major system**, not all

If you want, I can:

* Help you **trim this into a tighter version**
* Design a **starter/intro variant**
* Balance victory conditions
* Or rewrite parts for clarity without changing mechanics
